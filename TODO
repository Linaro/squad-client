Things to improve in squad-client 

* create a cache mechanism: sometimes same objects are requested over and over, where
  instead they could be stored in memory, that'd save up a few HTTP requests

* I think we can improve this: https://github.com/Linaro/squad/issues/634 by using
  the same approach that was used to improve performance of finding regressions and fixes.
  Instead of querying all tests of a given testrun, maybe we can pass up to 200 testruns at
  at time to reduce trips to the api.

* we should pick a license before migrating this repo to Linaro's: MIT, BST, 2-clause... ?

* add copyright Linaro, authors Charles and Amro
